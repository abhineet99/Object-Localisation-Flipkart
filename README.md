# Object_Localisation_Flipkart
This repo deals with object localisation problem statement in FlipkartGrid contest. The problem includes giving a rectangle's coordinates which encloses the object given in the image.

The train file is flipkart_try_1. It is used to read data from csv file, assuming that csv file has rows in the compatible format and train the model.

We used MobileNet_V2.
